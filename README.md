# OneNote VBA Host

This is a toolkit I am developing to complement 2016 version (no loner working on the 2010 version, included as is)

I needed a few functions that the Onetastic kit doesnt seem to be able to do quickly so I am doing it in VBA

Currently the script can do
a) Export each page as pdf/word with a cleanup of the title (add prefix and a cleanup)
b) Export each page and its embedded files (horray), prefixing with parent page title (sanitised)
c) Add references to the page based on how I tend to reference my pages at work

They are quite specific to my use case, but I think it is a good starting point for other uses
(it took me ages to find out how to do these things in VBA so hopefully you will be able to build on this)
